# 📝 Automated Essay Scoring System using Machine Learning
An automated essay scoring system using machine learning to classify essays into grade categories. It trains on a labeled dataset, predicts scores for new essays, and compares results with actual grades to evaluate accuracy. Includes preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using standard ML techniques.This project aims to build an automated essay assessment system using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to classify student-written essays into discrete grade categories based on their content and quality.

# 🚀 Features
Trains machine learning classifiers on a labeled dataset of essays

Predicts grades for unseen essays using the trained model

Compares predicted grades with actual grades to evaluate model accuracy

Supports preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization, etc.)

Includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

# 🧠 Technologies Used
Java

Scikit-learn / NLTK / Pandas

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

# 📂 Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset of student essays with labeled grades.

# 📈 Goals
Automate essay grading to reduce manual effort

Explore the effectiveness of various ML models in textual classification

Understand linguistic features that contribute to essay quality
